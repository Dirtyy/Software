Here is our take on the famous Facebook programming assessment - the Coin Change problem
A car park has a payment machine that accepts only cash - notes and coins
It's a max stay 24-hour car park, so cars cannot stay longer than this duration or they get towed!
It costs £3.00 for the first hour, and then 1p for every extra min stayed.
Coins are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1; Notes can be £5, £10, and £20
Write code in any language to take inputs: Time/date in, Time/date Out; then calculate and output Cost, then ask for Payment in and the calculate Output Change in the least amount of coins/notes for change
